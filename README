One of the tutorials I have found most useful for learning basic OpenGL has been the work done by Jason L. McKesson at http://arcsynthesis.org/gltut/index.html. 

This project is an attempt to translate his tutorials into WebGL, largely as an exercise to teach myself, but also in the hopes that someone reading along with his book might want to learn on the web as well.
